    <h1>ASL Translator Overview</h1>
    <p> The Asl Translator was trained on the YOLOv8 model. We used a dataset of around 1700 images. The dataset was from
      Roboflow and was uploaded by David Lee, who took the photos. Approximately 80% of the data was used for training and the
      rest for testing and validation. We created this website, trained the model, and hosted the model during the Drexel CCI Data
      Science camp. By leveraging YOLOv8, known for its efficiency in real-time object detection tasks, the ASL translator
       demonstrates high accuracy and speed, essential for effective communication in dynamic environments.

    <h1>Mission Statement</h1>
    <p> During our research of potential ideas, we came across some striking statistics regarding the population of deal people
       and people who know ASL. According to the 2021 American Community Survey (ACS), about 11 million individuals in the 
       United States are deaf or hard of hearing, however only around half a million Americans use ASL as their native language.
       This sparked the creation of ASL Translator. This technological 
       innovation not only enhances accessibility for the hearing impaired but also serves as a testament to the transformative 
       power of AI in fostering inclusivity and understanding across diverse communities.
